# ðŸ§¾ Statement of Work (SOW)

## **Project Title**
**Web-based Hash Calculator for File Integrity Verification**

---

## **Objective**
To design a simple web application that calculates file hashes (MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256) to verify data integrity and demonstrate how hashing supports cybersecurity principles.

---

## **Scope**
This project is for **local-only**, educational use.  
It will not involve user accounts or external storage.  
The app will allow users to upload a file, compute its hash, and compare results.

---

## **Tools and Technologies**
-  Python (hashlib library)  
-  Flask (backend framework)  
-  HTML/CSS (frontend interface)

---

## **Deliverables**
1. Flask-based web app  
2. Research report on hashing in cybersecurity  
3. Screenshots and documentation  
4. Final demo and presentation

---

## **Expected Outcome**
A functioning local web tool that verifies file integrity using cryptographic hash algorithms.

---

## **Duration**
Week 1 â€” Project planning and environment setup  
Week 2 â€” Core functionality (hashing logic)  
Week 3 â€” UI development  
Week 4 â€” Testing, documentation, and demo
